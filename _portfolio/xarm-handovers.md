In this project, we trained an agent to dynamically hand over an object to a human. Using deep reinforcement learning, we train the arm to identify an object placed in front of it. It repeatedly chooses a small joint movement that will result in a position closer to a grasp, eventually getting close enough to grasp the object from a user's hand.
