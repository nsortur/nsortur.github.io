I'm a third-year undergraduate student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu) studying Computer Science, with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and a minor in Mathematics.

I'm currently doing research in the Geometric Learning Lab advised by [Professor Robin Walters](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/robin-walters/) focusing on efficient control with equivariant learning in space applications, and also have been involved with the [The Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/). My research interests are still being discovered within AI and engineering, but my past experiences involve reinforcement learning and robotics.

- (04/23) I'm presenting my co-authored work on [learning with latent symmetries](https://nsortur.github.io/publication/iclr2023) at [RISE](https://undergraduate.northeastern.edu/research/rise-2023/overview/), Northeastern's annual research expo. See [my poster here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zKoX4EBMvLhzg2CjEZuvNoKS3bTbCODz/view?usp=sharing).
- (02/23) I was awarded a [PEAK Award](https://undergraduate.northeastern.edu/research/awards/peak-awards-overview/) by the Northeastern Undergraduate Research and Fellowships office for my exploratory work on efficient equivariant control for satellite formation flying.
- (01/23) This summer, I will be interning at [Blue Origin](https://www.blueorigin.com/) working on avionics software for the New Shepard rocket to pursue my passion for space.
