I'm a senior undergraduate student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu) studying Computer Science, with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and a minor in Mathematics. I'm currently doing a research co-op at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/), solving differentiable inverse design problems in the radar domain. I've worked in the Geometric Learning Lab advised by [Professor Robin Walters](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/robin-walters/), and also have been involved with the [The Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/).

My current research interests involve transparent machine learning in physical systems for algorithmic design, decision-making, and dynamics modeling. I'm looking for PhD programs, with the goal of further understanding the requirements for safe AGI by investigating these topics.

## Updates

- (11/23) I'll be at [Boston Symmetry Day](https://bostonsymmetry.github.io/) at MIT, presenting my work on equivariant drag coefficient modeling. See [my poster here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zzij9DD0IEAZeS4aAe_zMU1thHt1FJFc/view?usp=sharing).
- (10/23) Our work on equivariant drag coefficient modeling was accepted to the [NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations (NeurReps)](https://www.neurreps.org/about) [camera-ready available soon].
- (09/23) This Fall, I am pursuing full-time machine learning research at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/) as a co-op student.
- (05/23) I began my internship at [Blue Origin](https://www.blueorigin.com/) working on avionics software for the New Shepard rocket.
- (04/23) I'm presenting our work on [equivariant learning with latent symmetries](https://nsortur.github.io/publication/iclr2023) at [RISE](https://undergraduate.northeastern.edu/research/rise-2023/overview/), Northeastern's annual research expo. See [my poster here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zKoX4EBMvLhzg2CjEZuvNoKS3bTbCODz/view?usp=sharing).
- (02/23) I was awarded a [PEAK Award](https://undergraduate.northeastern.edu/research/awards/peak-awards-overview/) by the Northeastern Undergraduate Research and Fellowships office for my exploratory work on efficient equivariant control for satellite formation flying.
- (01/23) Our work on [equivariant learning with latent symmetries](https://nsortur.github.io/publication/iclr2023) was accepted spotlight (notable-top-25%) to ICLR 2023.
