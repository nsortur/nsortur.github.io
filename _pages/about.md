I'm a master's student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu) and an NSF Graduate Research Fellow [(GRFP)](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) in artificial intelligence. I am advised by [Professor Robin Walters](http://www.robinwalters.com/) in the Geometric Learning Lab, as well as a research assistant at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/).

My research interest is robust and interpretable machine learning for physical systems. Recently, this has been through creating physics-informed deep dynamics models, and using these models for generative mesh design. I have also previously applied my work to robot learning.
